Day 21 â€“ JavaScript Introduction

JavaScript (JS) is a programming language used to make webpages dynamic and interactive.
It can change content, styles, and respond to user actions without reloading the page.
JS runs in the browser and can also run on servers (Node.js).
Basic usage is inside the <script> tag or in an external .js file linked with <script src="file.js"></script>.
Example:

<script>
alert("Welcome to JavaScript!");
console.log("Hello World!");
</script>


JS allows dynamic content, interactivity, and control over HTML elements.
