Day 10 – HTML Comments and Entities

HTML comments are used to explain code, add notes, or hide code temporarily.
They are written inside <!-- --> and are not displayed in the browser.
Example:

<!-- This is a comment -->
<p>This is visible content.</p>


Comments help developers understand code better when revisiting later.

HTML entities are special codes that display reserved or invisible characters.
They begin with & and end with ;.
For example:
&lt; = <, &gt; = >, &amp; = &, &nbsp; = non-breaking space, &copy; = © symbol.
Entities ensure symbols and characters appear correctly in the browser.
They are especially useful when writing code snippets or symbols that HTML normally uses for tags.
