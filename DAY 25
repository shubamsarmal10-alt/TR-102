Day 25 – DOM Manipulation

DOM (Document Object Model) represents the HTML structure as objects in JavaScript.
JS can read, modify, or delete elements, change styles, and respond to events.
Common methods:

getElementById() → select element by ID

getElementsByClassName() → select elements by class

querySelector() → select first matching element

innerHTML → change content
Example:

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Welcome User!";
document.querySelector("p").style.color = "blue";


JS events like onclick, onmouseover, onchange make pages interactive and user-friendly.
DOM manipulation is essential for modern dynamic websites, allowing developers to control content, layout, and behavior in real-time.
