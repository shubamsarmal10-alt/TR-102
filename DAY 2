Structure of an HTML Document

Every HTML page follows a basic structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>

Declares the HTML version and tells the browser to render the page in standard mode.

<html>

Root element of the HTML document. All content is inside this tag.

<head>

Contains metadata, page title, styles, scripts, and other non-visible content.

<body>

Contains all visible content, such as text, images, links, videos, and forms.

Types of HTML Tags

Structural Tags: <html>, <head>, <body>

Text Formatting Tags: <h1>â€“<h6>, <p>, <b>, <i>, <u>, <strong>

Hyperlink Tags: <a>

List Tags: <ul> (unordered), <ol> (ordered), <li> (list item)

Image & Media Tags: <img>, <audio>, <video>

Table Tags: <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>

Form Tags: <form>, <input>, <button>, <textarea>, <select>

Semantic Tags (HTML5): <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, <section>

Advantages of HTML

Universal compatibility: Works on all browsers and devices.

Easy to learn: No programming knowledge required.

Supports multimedia: Can embed images, videos, and interactive content.

Integrates with CSS & JavaScript: For styling and dynamic behavior.

Lightweight: HTML files are small in size and load quickly.

Limitations of HTML

Static: Cannot create dynamic behavior on its own (requires JavaScript).

Presentation-limited: Cannot handle advanced styling or animations without CSS.

Security: Vulnerable if used improperly (e.g., forms without validation).
