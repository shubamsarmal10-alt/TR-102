Day 22 – Variables and Data Types

Variables store information that can be used later in the program.
Declared with var, let, or const.
Common data types:

String → text "Hello"

Number → numeric 25

Boolean → true or false

Array → list [1,2,3]

Object → key-value pair {name:"John", age:21}
Example:

let name = "John";
const age = 21;
var isStudent = true;


Variables and data types are essential for storing and manipulating information.
