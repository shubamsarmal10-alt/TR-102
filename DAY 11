Day 11 – Introduction to CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
It is used to style HTML elements and make webpages visually attractive.
CSS can change colors, fonts, layout, spacing, borders, and more.
Three types of CSS:

Inline CSS – inside HTML tag using style attribute.

Internal CSS – inside <style> tag in <head>.

External CSS – in a separate .css file linked with <link>.
Example (inline CSS):

<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">Hello CSS!</p>


CSS separates design from content, making code cleaner.
