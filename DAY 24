Day 24 â€“ Loops and Functions

Loops repeat code multiple times, reducing repetition.

For loop: repeats known times.

While loop: repeats until a condition is false.

Do-while loop: executes first, then checks condition.
Functions are reusable blocks of code.
Example:

for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Count: " + i);
}

function greet(name){
  console.log("Hello " + name + "!");
}
greet("John");


Loops and functions simplify programming logic and efficiency.
