Day 23 â€“ Operators and Conditional Statements

Operators are symbols that perform operations:

Arithmetic: + - * / %

Assignment: =, +=, -=

Comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

Logical: &&, ||, !
Conditional statements make decisions in code.
Example:

let marks = 75;
if(marks >= 50) {
  alert("Pass");
} else if(marks >= 40) {
  alert("Need Improvement");
} else {
  alert("Fail");
}


Conditionals help programs respond differently based on data.
